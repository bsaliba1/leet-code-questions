# LeetCodeQuestions
A repo of all my solutions to leetcode questions and my notes on how I solved them

## Game Plan

1. Do Breadth-First Scan of “Easy” questions from each Topic on Leetcode
    1. Try to get it right on the first try
    2. Should be finishing these in < 10 minutes
    3. Take note of which sections you struggled at (the following was for me)
        1. Trees
        2. Dynamic Programming
2. Do more “Easy” questions from the topics you struggled at
3. Shuffle “Medium” problems
    1. Only do the problems you are not 100% sure how to do
    2. Start a 25 minute pomodoro timer and attempt to solve it
    3. If the problem isn’t solved in 25 minutes, take a look at the discussion section but do NOT look at code just yet
        1. Reset the timer and do another pomodoro
        2. Once the problem is done, look at the discussion section and understand how other people solved it
        3. Write this problem down in your notes as a problem you need to revisit
4. Do the popular “Hard” problems from each Topic
    1. Try to finish these within 45 minutes
5. Do a mock interview AT LEAST once a week
6. Towards the last month of interview prep, do the 1-month term plan in EPI on PAPER

## Organization
    
### general
This directory contains subdirectories for all of the algorithm topics on leetcode. Within the subdirectories the problems are named according to their number on leetcode (ex. problem 99 => 99.py)

### blind_75
This directory contains solutions to the Blind 75 list, organized by day.

### notes
This directory is my personal little space for keeping notes on important things I learned.
- python_notes.md - Contains my notes on basic python syntax and functions as they are used for each topic
- problems_to_review.md - Problems I need to revisit
- review_topics.md - Lists all of the algorithm topics and subtopics that I need to review
